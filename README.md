# Work Day Scheduler 

## Description

For this project, I attempted to have each hour reflect different colors based off of past, present and future. I also attempted to have each user input saved to local storage. 

## Installation 

1. From the "work-day-scheduler" repository (https://github.com/RG-GitUser/work-day-scheduler) select the "Code" dropdown.
2. Using the "Code" dropdown, click on "SSH".
3. On the "SSH" tab, select the "copy" button next to  the address.
4. Next, open your git bash terminal (or for mac users, homebrew)
5. Use the command "git clone" and "insert coppied SSH key here" then press enter. 
6. Enter the "cd "enter path here" " command to navigate to the correct directory. 
7. You now have the repository cloned to your system! To verify, the command "ls" to view the items listed inside of the repository. 


## Usage 

As a user, you'll want to save all of your tasks in each timeblock to keep track of what you need to get done in a day.
